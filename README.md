MiniDungeon
===========

MiniDungeon is a simple Unity3D project that generates a procedural randomized dungeon.

This is a small project that I originally put together as part of a 48 hour game development challenge. I never finished the game, and it's not the cleanest code - but there was some interest by others in using the random dungeon generator as the basis for their own project, so here it is. This project includes a very, very simple game framework.

Last tested with Unity 4.6.1f1.
